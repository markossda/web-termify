## Key Features (All 100% Free)

### Native Pronunciation and IPA Transcriptions
Every term includes professional native speaker pronunciation recordings paired with IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) transcriptions. This ensures professionals learn to pronounce every term correctly — critical for aviation radio communication, maritime bridge operations, and international business meetings. IPA transcriptions are available for all 4,230+ terms at no cost.

### Adaptive Spaced Repetition
Termify uses an adaptive spaced repetition algorithm that tracks learning progress and schedules review sessions at optimal intervals. Terms found difficult appear more frequently, while mastered terms are spaced further apart. This scientifically-proven method helps professionals retain terminology significantly longer than traditional flashcard methods.

### Real-World Dialogue Scenarios
Industry-specific dialogue scenarios simulate real professional communication: controller-pilot exchanges, captain-crew bridge commands, SOC analyst-manager incident discussions, banker-client conversations, shipper-forwarder negotiations, and engineer-ops incident response coordination. Each dialogue uses authentic terminology from official industry standards.

### Career Quizzes with PDF Certificates
Career quizzes test terminology knowledge under exam-like conditions. Upon completion, professionals earn shareable PDF certificates that demonstrate professional English proficiency to employers, certification bodies, and hiring managers. All quizzes and certificates are completely free.
