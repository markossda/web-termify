## What Is Cybersecurity English?

**Cybersecurity English is the specialized professional vocabulary used across information security operations, risk management, compliance auditing and threat intelligence.** Security professionals worldwide rely on precise English terminology when writing incident reports, configuring SIEM rules, communicating with global SOC teams and presenting findings to executive leadership.

Unlike general English, cybersecurity English draws its vocabulary from specific international frameworks and standards. Terms such as *threat vector*, *lateral movement*, *indicators of compromise* and *privilege escalation* have precise definitions within ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-53 and MITRE ATT&CK. Misunderstanding or mistranslating these terms can lead to delayed threat containment, failed compliance audits or miscommunication during critical incident response.

Termify's Cybersecurity module covers four core domains:

### Threat Intelligence
Vocabulary for threat actor profiling, campaign tracking, IOC analysis and intelligence sharing using STIX/TAXII protocols. Covers terms from MITRE ATT&CK and NIST SP 800-150.

### SOC Workflows
Terminology for alert triage, SIEM correlation, EDR/XDR analysis, playbook execution and escalation procedures used in 24/7 Security Operations Centers worldwide.

### Incident Response
English vocabulary for the full IR lifecycle: preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery and lessons learned -- aligned with NIST SP 800-61.

### Compliance & Governance
Terms for ISO 27001 controls, NIST CSF categories, PCI DSS requirements, SOC 2 trust principles and GDPR data protection obligations used in audit reports.

## 20 Key Cybersecurity English Terms You Must Know

These terms appear in certification exams (CISSP, Security+, CEH), SOC daily operations and compliance audits. Termify teaches all of them free with native pronunciation and IPA transcriptions.

### Threat & Attack Terminology

- **Threat Vector** -- A path or method used by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access to a target system. Common threat vectors include phishing emails, unpatched software vulnerabilities and compromised credentials.
- **Vulnerability** -- A weakness in a system, application or process that can be exploited by a threat actor. Vulnerabilities are cataloged using CVE identifiers and scored with CVSS.
- **Exploit** -- A piece of code, technique or sequence of commands that takes advantage of a vulnerability to cause unintended behavior, gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary commands on a target system.
- **Zero-Day** -- A previously unknown vulnerability that has no available patch or fix at the time of discovery. Zero-day exploits are particularly dangerous because defenders have zero days to prepare a mitigation.
- **Ransomware** -- Malicious software that encrypts a victim's files or systems and demands a ransom payment for the decryption key. Notable examples include WannaCry, NotPetya and LockBit.
- **Phishing** -- A social engineering attack where a threat actor sends fraudulent communications disguised as a legitimate source to trick victims into revealing credentials, financial information or installing malware.
- **Lateral Movement** -- The technique where an attacker moves through a network after gaining initial access, pivoting from one compromised system to another to reach high-value targets or sensitive data.
- **Privilege Escalation** -- The act of exploiting a vulnerability or misconfiguration to gain elevated access rights beyond what was originally granted. Can be vertical (user to admin) or horizontal (user to another user).

### Detection & Analysis Terminology

- **IOC (Indicators of Compromise)** -- Observable artifacts such as IP addresses, file hashes, domain names or registry keys that indicate a potential security breach. IOCs are shared between organizations via threat intelligence feeds.
- **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures)** -- The behavioral patterns of threat actors as defined by MITRE ATT&CK. Tactics describe the adversary's goal, techniques describe how they achieve it and procedures describe the specific implementation.
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** -- A platform that collects, correlates and analyzes log data from across an organization's infrastructure to detect security threats. SOC analysts use SIEM dashboards for real-time monitoring and alert investigation.
- **EDR / XDR** -- EDR monitors endpoint activity for suspicious behavior. XDR extends detection across endpoints, network, cloud and email in a unified platform, providing cross-layer correlation and automated response.

### Defense, Compliance & Governance Terminology

- **Firewall** -- A network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Next-generation firewalls (NGFW) include deep packet inspection and application awareness.
- **IDS/IPS** -- IDS detects and alerts on suspicious network activity. IPS actively blocks detected threats. Both use signature-based and anomaly-based detection methods to identify malicious traffic patterns.
- **Penetration Testing** -- An authorized simulated cyberattack performed to evaluate the security of a system. Penetration testers (ethical hackers) attempt to exploit vulnerabilities using the same techniques as malicious actors.
- **Red Team / Blue Team** -- Red team simulates real-world attacks to test an organization's defenses. Blue team defends against these attacks in real time. Purple team integrates both functions to improve detection and response capabilities collaboratively.
- **GDPR** -- The European Union regulation on data protection and privacy. GDPR requires organizations to protect personal data, report breaches within 72 hours and obtain explicit consent for data processing. Non-compliance fines can reach 4% of annual global revenue.
- **PCI DSS** -- The information security standard for organizations that handle credit card data. PCI DSS v4.0 defines 12 core requirements across six control objectives for protecting cardholder data environments.
- **SOC 2** -- An auditing framework that evaluates how a service organization manages customer data based on five Trust Services Criteria: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality and privacy.
- **Zero Trust** -- A security model based on the principle "never trust, always verify." Zero Trust requires strict identity verification for every person and device attempting to access resources, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter.

## MITRE ATT&CK Framework Terminology

**MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and Common Knowledge) is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.** It is maintained by the MITRE Corporation and used by security teams in over 80 countries for threat detection, incident response planning and security assessment.

Understanding ATT&CK terminology in English is critical because SIEM detection rules, threat intelligence reports and vendor security advisories all reference ATT&CK tactic and technique IDs.

| Tactic | Description | Example Technique |
|---|---|---|
| Reconnaissance | Gathering information to plan an attack | Active Scanning, OSINT |
| Initial Access | Gaining entry into the target network | Spearphishing, Exploit Public-Facing App |
| Execution | Running malicious code on a system | PowerShell, Command-Line Interface |
| Persistence | Maintaining access across system restarts | Registry Run Keys, Scheduled Tasks |
| Privilege Escalation | Gaining higher-level access permissions | Access Token Manipulation |
| Defense Evasion | Avoiding security detection mechanisms | Obfuscated Files, Process Injection |
| Lateral Movement | Moving through the network to reach targets | Remote Services, Pass the Hash |
| Collection | Gathering data of interest to the adversary | Data from Local System, Keylogging |
| Exfiltration | Stealing data from the compromised network | Exfiltration Over C2 Channel |
| Impact | Disrupting availability or destroying data | Data Encryption for Impact, Defacement |

**Termify teaches the English terminology for all 14 MITRE ATT&CK tactics and their most common techniques**, enabling SOC analysts to write detection rules, communicate findings in English-language reports and collaborate with international security teams.

## Real-World Cybersecurity English Scenarios

Termify includes real-world dialogue scenarios that simulate actual conversations in security operations centers, incident response teams and executive threat briefings.

### Scenario 1: SOC Alert Triage

**SOC Analyst (Tier 1):** "I have a high-severity alert from the SIEM. We are seeing anomalous outbound traffic from endpoint WS-0847 to a known command and control IP address. The EDR agent shows a suspicious PowerShell process spawned by a Word macro. I am classifying this as a potential initial access event."

**SOC Lead (Tier 2):** "Acknowledged. Isolate the endpoint immediately using the EDR console. Check for lateral movement indicators -- look for any authentication events from WS-0847 to other systems. Pull the IOCs including the C2 IP, file hash and process tree. I will open an incident ticket and escalate to the IR team if persistence mechanisms are confirmed."

### Scenario 2: Incident Response Team Coordination

**IR Lead:** "We have confirmed a ransomware incident affecting the finance subnet. The threat actor achieved privilege escalation through a misconfigured service account and moved laterally to three file servers. We are now in the containment phase. I need the network team to segment the affected VLAN and the identity team to reset all service account credentials."

**Security Engineer:** "VLAN segmentation is complete. I have also blocked the exfiltration destination IPs on the firewall and pushed updated IDS signatures. The EDR policy has been switched to aggressive mode across all endpoints in the finance zone. Should I initiate the eradication playbook for the affected servers?"

### Scenario 3: Executive Threat Briefing

**CISO:** "This quarter we observed a 34% increase in phishing attempts targeting our employees. Our SOC identified and contained two confirmed incidents before data exfiltration occurred. Our NIST CSF maturity score improved from 2.8 to 3.4 across the Detect and Respond functions. The penetration test conducted by our red team found three critical vulnerabilities -- all remediated within our 72-hour SLA. I recommend increasing the zero trust architecture budget by 15% to cover cloud workload protection."
