## What Is Aviation English?

Aviation English is the standardized English language used for radiotelephony communication between pilots and air traffic controllers (ATC). Governed by ICAO Doc 9432 (Manual of Radiotelephony) and the FAA Pilot/Controller Glossary (PCG), aviation English ensures safety-critical clarity in every phase of flight -- from departure clearance to final approach.

ICAO Assembly Resolution A38-8 mandates that all pilots and air traffic controllers engaged in international operations demonstrate English language proficiency at ICAO Level 4 (Operational) or above. This requirement was introduced after several fatal accidents were attributed to communication failures caused by language barriers, including the 1977 Tenerife disaster and the 1996 Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision.

Aviation English differs from general English in several critical ways. It uses standardized phraseology where specific words carry precise operational meanings. The word "roger" means "I have received all of your last transmission." The word "wilco" means "I have received your message, understand it, and will comply." These terms are not interchangeable and must be used exactly as defined by ICAO standards.

Termify teaches aviation English 100% free with native pronunciation recordings, IPA transcriptions, real pilot-ATC dialogue scenarios and career quizzes. Every term is sourced from official ICAO and FAA documents.

| Level 1 | Pre-elementary | Below operational standard. Cannot communicate effectively. | Not permitted internationally |
| Level 2 | Elementary | Limited to isolated words and memorized phrases. | Not permitted internationally |
| Level 3 | Pre-operational | Can communicate on familiar topics but struggles with complex situations. | Not permitted internationally |
| Level 4 | Operational | Minimum for international operations. Handles routine and some non-routine situations. | Valid for 3 years |
| Level 5 | Extended | Advanced proficiency. Handles complex situations and unfamiliar topics. | Valid for 6 years |
| Level 6 | Expert | Native or near-native proficiency. No operational language limitations. | Lifetime validity |
