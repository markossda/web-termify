## What Is Logistics English?

**Logistics English is the specialized English vocabulary used in international trade, freight forwarding, customs brokerage, supply chain management and warehouse operations.** It encompasses the technical terms, abbreviations, document titles and regulatory language that logistics professionals use daily when coordinating cross-border shipments, clearing customs, managing inventory and reporting supply chain performance.

Unlike general business English, logistics English requires precise understanding of trade terms defined by the ICC (Incoterms 2020), shipping documentation standards established by FIATA, dangerous goods regulations from IATA and customs procedures governed by the WCO. A single misinterpreted term in a Bill of Lading or Letter of Credit can cause shipment delays, financial penalties or cargo disputes.

Termify's Logistics module teaches this specialized vocabulary with native pronunciation, IPA transcriptions, real-world dialogue scenarios between freight forwarders, customs brokers and supply chain managers, and career quizzes with shareable PDF certificates. **Termify is 100% free** -- no subscription, no hidden fees.

### Rules for Any Mode of Transport (7 Rules)

These seven Incoterms 2020 rules can be used for any mode of transport including road, rail, air, sea and multimodal.

- **EXW -- Ex Works**: The seller makes goods available at their premises. The buyer bears all costs and risks from the seller's location to the final destination, including export clearance. EXW places minimum obligation on the seller.
- **FCA -- Free Carrier**: The seller delivers goods cleared for export to the carrier nominated by the buyer at a named place. Risk transfers when goods are handed to the carrier. FCA is the recommended replacement for FOB in containerized shipping.
- **CPT -- Carriage Paid To**: The seller pays freight to the named destination, but risk transfers to the buyer when goods are handed to the first carrier. CPT is the multimodal equivalent of CFR.
- **CIP -- Carriage and Insurance Paid To**: Same as CPT, but the seller also obtains insurance coverage (ICC Clause A -- all risks) to the named destination. Under Incoterms 2020, CIP requires maximum coverage, unlike CIF which requires only minimum coverage.
- **DAP -- Delivered at Place**: The seller delivers goods at the buyer's disposal at the named destination, not unloaded and not cleared for import. The seller bears all costs and risks to the destination point.
- **DPU -- Delivered at Place Unloaded**: The seller delivers goods unloaded at the named destination. DPU is the only Incoterm that requires the seller to unload at destination. Formerly known as DAT (Delivered at Terminal) in Incoterms 2010.
- **DDP -- Delivered Duty Paid**: The seller bears all costs and risks including import duties, taxes and customs clearance to deliver goods at the buyer's premises. DDP represents maximum seller obligation -- the opposite of EXW.

### Rules for Sea and Inland Waterway Transport Only (4 Rules)

These four Incoterms 2020 rules apply exclusively to sea and inland waterway transport.

- **FAS -- Free Alongside Ship**: The seller delivers goods alongside the vessel at the named port of shipment. Risk transfers when goods are placed alongside the ship.
- **FOB -- Free On Board**: The seller delivers goods on board the vessel at the named port of shipment. Risk transfers when goods pass the ship's rail. FOB is one of the most commonly used Incoterms in international maritime trade. ICC recommends FCA for containerized shipments.
- **CFR -- Cost and Freight**: The seller pays freight to the named port of destination, but risk transfers when goods are loaded on board the vessel at the port of shipment. CFR is the sea-only equivalent of CPT.
- **CIF -- Cost, Insurance and Freight**: Same as CFR, but the seller also obtains minimum insurance coverage (ICC Clause C) to the named port of destination. Under Incoterms 2020, CIF requires only minimum coverage while CIP requires all-risks coverage.
