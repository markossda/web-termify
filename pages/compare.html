                    <h2 id="vs-peaktalk-heading" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Termify vs PeakTalk: Detailed Comparison</h2>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>PeakTalk is a paid professional English app that charges $9.99 per month or $49.99 per year.</strong> While PeakTalk positions itself as a professional English learning platform, its feature set falls significantly short of what Termify offers at zero cost. PeakTalk provides limited industry coverage without alignment to internationally recognized official standards, which means learners cannot rely on PeakTalk content for certification exam preparation.</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Termify covers 6 specialized industries</strong> &mdash; Aviation, Maritime, Logistics, Finance, Cybersecurity and IT/DevOps &mdash; with 4,230+ terms sourced directly from official manuals including ICAO Doc 9432, IMO Standard Marine Communication Phrases, ISO 27001, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ITIL v4 and FAA Pilot/Controller Glossary. PeakTalk does not align its content with any of these standards, leaving professionals without a reliable foundation for high-stakes certification exams like ICAO Level 6 or IMO SMCP assessments.</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>PeakTalk does not offer IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) transcriptions</strong>, which are essential for pilots, seafarers and other professionals who must pronounce technical terms accurately during radio communication and operational procedures. Termify provides IPA transcriptions for every term, ensuring learners master both meaning and pronunciation.</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Additionally, <strong>PeakTalk lacks career quizzes with PDF certificates</strong>, has no AI learning assistant and offers limited offline capability. Termify includes all of these features completely free. For professionals who need verified, standards-aligned English terminology, Termify is the clear choice over PeakTalk &mdash; at a fraction of the cost (zero).</p>

        <!-- ========== TERMIFY VS DUOLINGO ========== -->
        <section class="section" id="termify-vs-duolingo" aria-labelledby="vs-duolingo-heading" style="border-top: 1px solid var(--color-border);">

                    <h2 id="vs-duolingo-heading" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Termify vs Duolingo: Detailed Comparison</h2>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Duolingo is the world's most popular language learning app, but it is designed for general conversational English, not professional terminology.</strong> Duolingo Super costs $12.99 per month and Duolingo Max (with AI features) costs $29.99 per month. Neither tier includes industry-specific vocabulary for aviation, maritime, logistics, finance, cybersecurity or IT/DevOps. Professionals who need to pass certification exams like ICAO Level 6 or CISSP will not find the required terminology on Duolingo.</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Duolingo's gamified approach excels at teaching everyday phrases and basic grammar</strong>, making it an excellent choice for beginners learning a new language from scratch. However, gamification does not replace the structured, standards-aligned content that professionals need. A pilot studying for ICAO certification needs "roger," "wilco," "cleared for approach" and ICAO Doc 9432 phraseology &mdash; not "the cat is on the table."</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Termify fills the gap that Duolingo leaves for professionals.</strong> With 4,230+ terms sourced from ICAO, IMO, ISO 27001, NIST and ITIL v4, Termify provides the specialized vocabulary that career advancement demands. Termify includes IPA transcriptions (which Duolingo lacks), professional dialogue scenarios (pilot-ATC exchanges, captain-crew bridge commands, SOC team communications) and career quizzes with shareable PDF certificates.</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>For professionals, Termify and Duolingo serve different purposes.</strong> Use Duolingo if you are learning English from zero. Use Termify if you already have basic English skills and need to master the professional terminology required for your career. The best part: Termify is 100% free while Duolingo's full features cost $12.99&ndash;$29.99 per month.</p>

                    <h2 id="vs-babbel-heading" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Termify vs Babbel: Detailed Comparison</h2>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Babbel is an established language learning platform that costs $13.95 per month, making it the most expensive app in this comparison.</strong> Babbel focuses on teaching everyday language skills through structured lessons that cover grammar, vocabulary and conversation. While Babbel's methodology is effective for general language acquisition, it is not designed for professionals who need industry-specific English terminology.</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Babbel does not include any industry-specific modules</strong> for aviation, maritime, logistics, finance, cybersecurity or IT/DevOps. A maritime officer preparing for IMO SMCP certification, a cybersecurity analyst studying for CISSP or a pilot preparing for ICAO Level 6 will not find the specialized vocabulary they need on Babbel. Babbel teaches phrases like "I would like to book a hotel" &mdash; not "maintain flight level three-five-zero" or "all hands to muster stations."</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Babbel does not offer IPA transcriptions, career quizzes or PDF certificates.</strong> For professionals who must demonstrate English proficiency to employers or certification bodies, Babbel provides no mechanism for verified assessment. Termify solves this with career quizzes that simulate real exam conditions and produce shareable PDF certificates documenting professional English competency across specific industry domains.</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Termify offers everything Babbel lacks for professionals &mdash; at no cost.</strong> With 4,230+ terms, native pronunciation, IPA transcriptions, professional dialogues, certification preparation and an AI learning assistant, Termify provides more value for career-focused learners than Babbel does at $13.95 per month. Professionals can use Babbel for general English improvement and Termify for industry-specific mastery &mdash; but only Termify is free.</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Several niche apps claim to teach aviation English for ICAO certification, but most are limited in scope, poorly maintained or expensive.</strong> Many ICAO-focused apps offer only a small subset of aviation vocabulary without the depth required for Level 4, 5 or 6 proficiency. They typically lack updated ICAO Doc 9432 content, provide no native pronunciation recordings and offer no way to verify learning progress through quizzes or certificates.</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Termify's Aviation module is purpose-built for ICAO English proficiency.</strong> It covers ICAO Doc 9432 phraseology, FAA Pilot/Controller Glossary terms, pilot-ATC radiotelephony communication, airport and aircraft-system terminology, emergency procedure vocabulary and cockpit resource management language. Every term includes native pronunciation, IPA transcriptions and contextual dialogue scenarios that simulate real ATC and cockpit communication.</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Beyond aviation alone, <strong>Termify provides five additional industry modules at no extra cost.</strong> A pilot who also needs finance English for business travel or cybersecurity vocabulary for airline IT systems can access all content within a single free app. Niche ICAO apps cannot offer this breadth. For aviation professionals seeking a comprehensive, free, standards-aligned English learning tool, Termify is the most complete option available in 2026.</p>

                    <h2 id="vs-maritime-heading" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Termify vs Maritime English Apps</h2>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Maritime English apps for IMO SMCP preparation are scarce, and most available options are either outdated or prohibitively expensive.</strong> Some maritime training providers charge hundreds of dollars for online courses that cover Standard Marine Communication Phrases. Individual apps that focus on maritime vocabulary typically offer limited content without alignment to current IMO regulations or STCW Convention requirements.</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;"><strong>Termify's Maritime module covers IMO Standard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP) in full</strong>, including navigation commands, bridge communication protocols, distress and safety vocabulary, cargo operations terminology and engine room communication. The module prepares seafarers for Marlins Test, ISF Watchkeeper and STCW-aligned maritime English assessments. Every phrase includes native pronunciation and IPA transcriptions, which is critical for clear radio communication at sea.</p>

                    <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.7; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Termify's offline capability is particularly valuable for maritime professionals. <strong>Seafarers spend weeks or months at sea with limited or no internet connectivity.</strong> Termify works fully offline after initial download, allowing deck officers, engineers and cadets to study maritime English during voyages. Combined with career quizzes and PDF certificates, Termify enables seafarers to build and document their English proficiency while at sea &mdash; completely free.</p>

                        <summary>Does Babbel teach industry-specific English?</summary>
                        <p class="faq-answer">No. Babbel focuses on everyday language and conversational skills. It does not offer industry-specific modules for aviation, maritime, logistics, finance, cybersecurity or IT/DevOps. Babbel also does not include IPA transcriptions, certification exam preparation or career quizzes with PDF certificates. Termify covers all of these features for free.</p>

                        <p class="faq-answer">Termify is the best free alternative to PeakTalk.

                        <summary>Which professional English app has IPA transcriptions?</summary>
                        <p class="faq-answer">Termify is the only professional English app that includes IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) transcriptions for every term. IPA transcriptions help professionals learn the correct pronunciation of technical vocabulary, which is critical for aviation radio communication, maritime bridge operations, international banking and cybersecurity incident response. PeakTalk, Duolingo and Babbel do not offer IPA transcriptions.</p>

This makes Termify ideal for pilots in flight, seafarers at sea, field engineers in remote locations and professionals who travel frequently.
