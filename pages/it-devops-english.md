## What Is IT/DevOps English?

**IT/DevOps English is the specialized vocabulary used by technology professionals to communicate about cloud architecture, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), site reliability engineering (SRE), infrastructure as code (IaC) and IT service management (ITSM).** Non-native English speakers working in global technology teams need this terminology to participate effectively in incident response calls, deployment meetings, architecture reviews and certification exams.

### Cloud Architecture
Cloud architecture terminology covers the English vocabulary used to design, deploy and manage applications on cloud platforms such as AWS, Microsoft Azure and GCP. Key concepts include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), virtual private clouds, subnets, load balancers, auto-scaling groups, content delivery networks and serverless computing. Professionals need this vocabulary to read cloud documentation, pass certification exams and communicate with cross-functional engineering teams.

### CI/CD Pipelines
CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery) English covers the terminology used in automated software delivery workflows. Key terms include build pipeline, test suite, deployment stage, artifact repository, rollback strategy, blue-green deployment, canary release, feature flag, release train and GitOps. DevOps engineers and platform engineers use this vocabulary daily when configuring Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI and ArgoCD pipelines.

### Incident Management
Incident management English covers the vocabulary used during real-time production incidents and post-incident analysis. Key terms include SLA, SLO, SLI, MTTR, MTTF, severity levels, escalation procedures, on-call rotation, runbook, war room, root cause analysis, post-mortem report and blameless retrospective. SRE teams and DevOps engineers use this language in PagerDuty alerts, Slack incident channels and status page updates.

### Infrastructure as Code
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) English covers the terminology for managing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files rather than manual processes. Key terms include Terraform modules, Ansible playbooks, CloudFormation stacks, ARM templates, Pulumi programs, state file, provider, resource, data source, provisioner, drift detection and idempotency.

## Real-World Scenarios Where IT/DevOps English Matters

### Incident Response Calls
**During a production incident, clear English communication can mean the difference between a 10-minute and a 2-hour outage.** Non-native speakers must quickly understand and use terms like severity escalation, blast radius, customer impact, rollback, hotfix and status page update.

- Declaring an incident: "We are declaring a SEV-1 incident for the payment service"
- Impact assessment: "The blast radius affects 12% of users in the EU region"
- Resolution action: "Initiating a rollback to the last known good deployment"
- Post-mortem summary: "Root cause was a misconfigured auto-scaling policy"

### Deployment Meetings
**Deployment meetings require precise English to discuss release schedules, risk assessments and rollback plans.**

- Release readiness: "All integration tests pass; canary is at 5% with no error spike"
- Risk assessment: "This change modifies the database schema; requires a maintenance window"
- Rollback criteria: "If error rate exceeds 0.5% we will trigger an automatic rollback"
- Post-deployment validation: "Smoke tests passed; monitoring dashboards show nominal metrics"

### Architecture Reviews
**Architecture reviews demand the ability to present, critique and document technical designs in English.**

- Design proposals: "We propose a microservices architecture with an API gateway for rate limiting"
- Trade-off analysis: "Eventual consistency reduces latency but increases complexity in conflict resolution"
- Scalability discussion: "Horizontal scaling with auto-scaling groups behind an application load balancer"
- Cost analysis: "Reserved instances reduce compute costs by 40% compared to on-demand pricing"

### Technical Documentation
**Writing clear technical documentation in English is a core skill for IT/DevOps professionals.** Runbooks must be precise enough for an on-call engineer to follow at 3 AM during an outage.

- Runbook entry: "Prerequisites: kubectl access, VPN connection to production cluster"
- API documentation: "Endpoint returns HTTP 429 when rate limit is exceeded; retry after X seconds"
- Troubleshooting step: "Check pod logs with kubectl logs; verify ConfigMap values match expected configuration"
- Architecture diagram label: "Load balancer distributes traffic across three availability zones"
