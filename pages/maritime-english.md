## What Is Maritime English?

Maritime English is the standardized form of English used for safety-critical communication in the international shipping industry. Governed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), maritime English ensures that officers, engineers and ratings from different language backgrounds can communicate clearly during navigation, cargo operations, emergency procedures and port state interactions.

The cornerstone of maritime English is the IMO Standard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP), adopted under IMO Resolution A.918(22) in 2001. SMCP replaced the earlier Standard Marine Navigational Vocabulary (SMNV) and provides a comprehensive framework of standardized phrases for use in all safety-related maritime communications. Competence in SMCP is a mandatory requirement under the STCW Convention (Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers) for all certified maritime officers and ratings worldwide.

Maritime English extends beyond vocabulary memorization. It encompasses precise pronunciation for VHF radio communication, understanding of bridge-to-bridge dialogue protocols, engine room communication standards and the ability to issue and respond to emergency commands under pressure. According to the IMO, communication failures remain a leading contributing factor in maritime accidents.

### Why Maritime English Proficiency Matters

The global shipping industry employs approximately 1.89 million seafarers from over 150 countries. On a single vessel, crew members may speak five or more native languages. Maritime English serves as the common operating language that prevents miscommunication during critical operations such as pilotage, anchoring, mooring, collision avoidance and emergency response. Port state control inspections frequently assess English language competence, and failing to demonstrate adequate maritime English can result in vessel detention, operational delays and career setbacks.

## IMO SMCP: The Three Parts Explained

The IMO Standard Marine Communication Phrases are organized into three distinct parts, each addressing a specific domain of maritime communication.

### Part A -- General Maritime English
Foundational phrases used across all shipboard contexts:
- Instruction marker phrases ("advice", "warning", "information")
- Responses and acknowledgements
- Distress, urgency and safety signals
- Standard organizational phrases
- Cardinal and ordinal numbers at sea

### Part B -- On-Board Communication
Phrases for internal ship operations between bridge, engine room, deck and cargo teams:
- Helm orders and engine orders
- Watchkeeping handover phrases
- Safety announcements and drills
- Cargo handling and tank operations
- Passenger and crew safety commands

### Part C -- External Communication
Phrases for ship-to-shore, ship-to-ship and port communication using VHF radio and GMDSS systems:
- Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) communication
- Pilotage and berthing phrases
- Search and rescue (SAR) coordination
- Meteorological and navigational warnings
- Port state control inspection phrases

Termify organizes its maritime English module following the IMO SMCP structure, allowing seafarers to study each part systematically. Every phrase includes the official IMO wording, contextual usage notes, native pronunciation and IPA transcription.

**Q: What is the difference between Mayday, Pan-Pan and Securite?**
A: Mayday is the distress signal used when a vessel or person is in grave and imminent danger requiring immediate assistance (fire, flooding, sinking). Pan-Pan is the urgency signal for serious situations without immediate threat to life (engine failure with no immediate danger). Securite is the safety signal for navigational or meteorological warnings (debris in fairway, weather warnings). All three follow specific SMCP procedures for transmission on VHF Channel 16. Termify teaches the complete procedure for each signal type.
